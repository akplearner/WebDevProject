The Mission:
Provide a place were we can all be the owners of our own medical data and records in order to provide them to our doctors/specialist or to be able to understand more about us with AI which no medical facility does as detail and effective as we do. Lets be in control of our own health and strive for a better future for our selfs and our loves ones.

Our srategy:
To provide  the best online service that we can keep our medicals conditions, our records history, medications intakes, etc. We are working in a circular enviroment consisting of hardware equipment available on the public market in order to have a continuous status of our health and other services like genetic analisys and emergency response care. To be the middle man of all the amazing technonolgies and services available to be the one place people would go to manage our own health.

reson why we doing this:
Because due to lack of time, resources, or knowledge for the mostw  part we are not able to manage our health or our love ones. This always resulting in a situation where it's to late to do anything about it. This has to stop, this doesnt have to be this way. Currently its complicated and unefficient to transfer records from one facility to another, to update our doctor about how we feel verbally or with limited info we manage to keep its ridiculus in this modern age. We are doing this because we need to give it our best to make sure our selfs and love ones life a happy and healthy life without pain or high medical cost, to make sure its not to late before we can do anything about it and keep families together, to give our selfs and our love ones another chance.
